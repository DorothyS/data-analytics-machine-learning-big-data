### Graphviz

In order to visualize the decision trees in Jupyter, you will need to install Graphviz as well as the Python package.

For the package install:
* Windows ([download](http://www.graphviz.org/download/))
* Mac ([download](http://www.graphviz.org/download/))
* Linux: `sudo apt-get install graphviz`

On Windows, once you install Graphviz, add the full path to the bin directory in the Graphviz to your PATH. 

To install the Python package on all operating systems: `pip install graphviz`
